            <h3>Manifesto – An open letter</h3>

            <p class="intro">TO: World leaders on all levels of power<br />
                FROM: Your citizens who are concerned with the lack of action towards battling the greatest war mankind has faced: climate change.
            </p>


            <p><b>We're mad as hell and we're not gonna take this anymore!</b></p>

            <p>We're mad because you, our leaders have been well aware of planetary risks of climate change for decades but <b>you have chosen to evade your responsibilities</b>. You have wasted critical time on partisan politics, empty debating, short-sighted greenwashing and useless tinkering.</p>

            <p>We're mad because the responsibility for saving the planet has trickled down to our individual choices as consumers – which, while important, clearly are not alone enough to remedy the crisis. </p>

            <p class="marker"><i class="fas fa-angle-double-left"></i> <i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i></p>

            <p>According to IPCC's report in October 2018, <b>a massive systemic change is required</b> for this planet to stay habitable. A systemic change that requires those in power to take action. To take action that is <b>concrete, swift and drastic.</b></p>

            <p>IPCC's report also affirms that we <b>CAN</b> still change the course and that we <b>DO</b> have the knowledge & tools to make it happen. What is required is the willpower to <b>MAKE IT HAPPEN</b>.</p>

            <p><b>We demand you, our leaders to START ACTING NOW.</b></p>


            <p class="marker"><i class="fas fa-angle-double-left"></i> <i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i></p>


            <p><b>We're here to support you.</b></p>

            <p>We're ready & willing to change our daily lives if it means a more habitable planet for our grandkids. We’re fine with eating less meat, using more public transport, avoiding flying, consuming less and paying carbon taxes if it means less cities destroyed by rising sea levels. <b>We will do our part, you do yours.</b></p>

            <p class="marker"><i class="fas fa-angle-double-left"></i> <i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i></p>

            <p><b>We're also here to watch you.</b></p>

            <p>If your actions aren’t impactful enough, you will hear from us. If you stall the positive change initiated by others, you will hear from us. Our feedback will be instant, it won’t wait for the next elections. We will utilize all legal & non-violent means at our disposal to make sure that <b>if you don’t do your damn job, it won’t be yours to keep</b>.</p>

            <p class="marker"><i class="fas fa-angle-double-left"></i> <i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i></p>

            <p>Step up your game, be the leaders your positions demand. Use all the power at your disposal and <b>ACT NOW DEAR IDIOTS!</b></p>


            <p>Yours truly,<br />
                concerned citizens</p>
