      <h3>Manifesto – An open letter</h3>
      
      <p class="intro">TO: World leaders on all levels of power<br />
FROM: Your citizens who are concerned with the lack of action towards battling the greatest war mankind has faced: climate change.
      </p>
      
      <p><b>We're mad as hell and we're not gonna take this anymore!</b> We're mad because you, our leaders have been well aware of climate change's planetary risks for decades without taking enough actions to change the course for the better. We're mad because the responsibility for saving the planet has trickled down to our choices as consumers – which, while important, clearly are not alone enough to remedy the situation.</p>
      <p> We're mad because you, our leaders have evaded your own responsibilities and have instead wasted critical time on partisan politics, useless debating in numerous committees, short-sighted greenwashing and minor tweaks that haven’t brought any real change.</p>
      
      <p class="marker"><i class="fas fa-angle-double-left"></i> <i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i></p>

<p>With IPCC's report in October 2018, it's clear that <b>a massive systemic change is required</b> for this planet to stay habitable. A systemic change that requires those in power to take action. To take action that is concrete, swift and drastic. IPCC's report is also clear on that we <b>CAN</b> still change the course and that we <b>DO</b> have the knowledge & tools to make it happen. What is required is the willpower to <b>MAKE IT HAPPEN</b>.</p> 
      <p><b>That is where we demand you, our leaders to START ACTING NOW</b>. Let us be clear on this: your earlier ways of working are not enough. We, the planet, the citizens, need you to level up.</p>

      <p class="marker"><i class="fas fa-angle-double-left"></i> <i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i></p>
      
<p><b>And we're here to support you.</b> We're understand that drastic times call for drastic measures. We encourage you to act in ways that produce truly significant change, because that is the only kind of change that will save us all. For our part, we're ready & willing to change our routines and daily lives if it means saving the planet and our species. We would be ok in eating way less meat if it means a more habitable planet for our grandkids. We would be fine with using more public transport if it means less cities destroyed by rising sea levels.</p>
      
      <p>We would manage with buying less unnecessary stuff if it means less people dying of extreme heat. We would live with paying more for and doing less air travel – if that means there’s still fish in the sea for future generations. We ask you to build the structures for these changes to happen. <b>We will do our part, you do yours.</b></p>

      <p class="marker"><i class="fas fa-angle-double-left"></i> <i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i></p>
      
<p><b>We're also here to watch you.</b> We will keep on reminding you if you seem to slip from the target. Our feedback will be instant, it won’t wait for the next elections. We will utilize all legal & non-violent means at our disposal to make sure you do your damn job. Should you fail to step up to the task, we will take to the streets and let you hear our feedback out in the open. We will flood your inbox with our messages, we will be all over media letting everyone know you aren’t fit for the job.</p>
      
      <p>If your actions aren’t impactful enough, you will hear from us. If your actions aren’t happening in the now, but you focus on what might be happening in 10 years, you will hear from us. If you stall the positive change initiated by others, you will hear from us. <b>In the end, if you don’t do your job, we will make sure the job isn’t yours to keep.</b></p>
<p class="marker"><i class="fas fa-angle-double-left"></i> <i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i></p>
<p>So for all of our sakes: <b>ACT NOW, DEAR IDIOTS!</b></p>

<p>Yours truly,<br /> 
concerned citizens</p>
